# bulk-redirects.sh
#
# DESCRIPTION
# The purpose of this script is to make bulk redirect changes easier and more accurate.
# When you want to move an entire directory to somewhere else in the taxonomy,
# you can use this script as part of a two step process:
#   1. Before you move any directories, run this script to add the current redirects.
#   2. After you run the script, manually move the directories to wherever you want them.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS
# To use this script:
#   1. Copy this script into the top-level directory containing the files to change.
#      For example, to create redirects for all the files in and under the "agents" 
#      directory, insert this script in the "agents" directory.
#   2. Open a command-line session and go to the directory where you copied this script.
#   3. Execute the script: bash bulk-redirects.sh
#   4. At the confirmation prompt, enter "y" to continue or "n" to exit.
#   5. When the script completes, copy the file "redirects-to-test.txt" to a safe place.
#
# Do the following housekeeping tasks:
#   1. Move the directories to their new location in the file system.
#   2. Manually move the old navigation tree in the .nav file either into its new location
#      in the same file, or move it to whichever .nav file yout want.
#   3. Do a search and replace on all the old prefixes, changing them to the new prefix. VS Code allows
#      regular expressions in search to help you target the values you want to change. 
#   4. Rebuild the site, confirm the left navigation works, and test each of the URLs in 
#      "redirects-to-test.txt."
